## Brewdogger: A simple ASP.NET Core 2.2 REST API about beer!
### What is Brewdogger?
Brewdogger is the result of scouring multiple beer-based APIs and not really
finding a simple implementation that really satisfied me. So, I did what every
good programmer does when he can't find what he, or she, is looking for... write 
my own API! Brewdogger consists of four separate projects:
1. Brewdogger.Api - the core logic and REST API
2. Brewdogger.Auth - the authentication and authorization API service (JWT)
3. Brewdogger.Tests - the unit test project for the core API
4. Brewdogger.Spa - the Angular 7 frontend

#### Dependencies
If you would like to contribute, the following external NuGet packages and versions (or higher) are required:
1. AutoMapper - v7.0.1
2. AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection - v5.0.1
3. FluentValidation - v8.0.100
4. FluentValidation.AspNetCore - v8.0.100
5. Newtonsoft.Json - v11.0.2

Any logging and database providers may be switched out to accommodate personal preferences. 
The project currently uses Serilog for logging and Entity Framework Core with Postgres and NpgSQL.
